  Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code. 
  The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. 
  CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

      CMSTP can be abused to run malicious code from specially prepared INF files.
    detection:
      ideas:
        - monitor unusual CMSTP parent processes (office apps, browsers, server apps etc).

      CMSTP can also be abused to run malicious code from external sources, like .SCT scripts
    detection:
