    - monitor for suspicious outbound network connections intiated by NOT Web browsers/Dropbox desktop client processes
      to Dropbox API IP range 162.125.70.0/24 (check your range, it may vary). Such activity is very suspicious.
      Note: in general web browsers don't have to use Dropbox API range, check it and remove 2nd condition if you wish.
  telemetry:
    network_connection:
      - Windows EID 5156
      - Sysmon EID 3
      - EDR (WFP)

    - Channel:Windows-Security AND EventID:5156 AND Direction:Outbound AND DestinationAddress:"162.125.70.0/24"

     - monitor for suspicious Dropbox API sub-domains DNS queries intiated by NOT Web browsers/Dropbox desktop client processes
       Note: in general web browsers don't have to query Dropbox API sub-domains, check it and remove 2nd condition if you wish.
   telemetry:
